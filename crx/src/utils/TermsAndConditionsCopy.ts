	5.	PURCHASE AND USE OF STREAM TOKEN

Stream Services may incorporate the use of Stream Token (the “Token”).  These cryptographic tokens may be purchased from Stream or a third party seller and transferred to other persons using the Services.  Persons that use the Services in connection with the Tokens acknowledge that:

	•	The Token is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction. This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. Ownership of the Token does not entitle the owner to any ownership or rights with respect to Stream, including distributions or voting rights.

	•	Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring the Token before doing so.  If you are not in the position to accept or understand the risks associated with purchasing the Token, you should not acquire the Token.

	•	You are not eligible and you shall not purchase the Token if you are a citizen or resident (tax or otherwise) of any country, state, or territory where the purchase of the Token or similar crypto tokens may be prohibited. By purchasing the Token, you represent and warrant that you are legally permitted to purchase the Token and assume the responsibility for complying with your applicable laws and regulations.

Purchasing and using the Token in conjunction with Stream Services carries significant risk.  As a user of the Services, you acknowledge the following risks:

	•	There is no assurance that at any time in the future the Token (i) may be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) may have any known uses outside the Services, or (iii) may be traded on any known exchange.

	•	User’s Tokens will be stored in a wallet, which can be accessed with a password selected by the user. If a user does not maintain an accurate record of his or her password, this may lead to the loss of Tokens. If a user’s password protection is weak and it is cracked, stolen or otherwise obtained by a third party, this may also lead to the loss of Tokens. As a result, users must safely store the passwords in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. Stream is not responsible for any Token purchaser’s loss of password or other credentials.

	•	As with other crypto tokens, the value of the Token may fluctuate significantly and become reduced in value for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall crypto token market conditions, political and geographical reasons, changes to laws and/or regulations in any jurisdiction, and technical reasons.

	•	The ownership of Tokens may fall under existing and/or new and unprecedented taxation laws.

	•	The Tokens exist on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum blockchain may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold the Tokens. Such impact could adversely affect the value of the Tokens.

	•	Many crypto tokens fluctuate in value in tandem with the market price of bitcoin and other tokens. It is possible that the Tokens will be affected by events that cause bitcoin or other tokens to increase or decrease in value.

	•	Regulators continue to provide guidance with respect to ambiguities in existing laws and regulations in the context of crypto tokens. Lawmakers and regulators are also considering and may approve new laws and regulations that govern the offering of crypto tokens. It is possible that a government or regulatory agency will pursue Stream and require it to suspend or cease its Services in light of a new interpretation of existing laws or regulations or the passage of new laws or regulations.

	•	Crypto tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth herein, there are risks that Stream cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth above.

Stream and its officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for your loss of any Tokens after it is transferred to you by any reason including but not limited to your failure to maintain or backup an accurate record of your password or password cracking by somebody due to your poor maintenance of your password.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated with crypto tokens throughout the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations, or actions may impact Stream Services. Any person undertaking to acquire Tokens must be aware that Stream Services may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws in any applicable jurisdictions. In such case, purchasers and any person undertaking to acquire Tokens acknowledge and understand that neither Stream nor any of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damages caused by such changes.
Acquiring Tokens shall not grant any right or influence over Stream’s organization and governance to the purchasers.
